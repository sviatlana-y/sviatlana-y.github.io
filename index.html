<h1> Welcome to my site! </h1>
<p> I am a student at <a href="https://yale-nus.edu.sg">Yale-NUS College</a>, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics, with a minor in Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences.</p>

<p>I have a budding interest in computer science and data science. This semester, I am completing a course in Programming for Data Science, where I am learning how to use Python and various Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, and even Tensorflow in order to make sense of unstructured data.</p>

<p> I'm currently looking for <strong>data science</strong> internship opportunities.

<p>You can reach me via <a href="s.yasiukova@u.yale-nus.edu.sg">my e-mail.</a></p>
